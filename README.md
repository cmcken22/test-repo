# Interview Scheduler

Interview scheduler is an application used to book interviews with available mentors for the selected day. It was built using React library to create a cutting edge user interface. By selecting days you can book a new appointment in the available spots or edit an existing one.

This project was developed as a learning tool from Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp to encompass building react componenets and perform extensive testing (Static, Unit, Integration, End-to-end)
